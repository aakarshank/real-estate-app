# real-estate-app

This app allows you to enter up a state and city in the U.S. and get a list of properties from that city, including details such as price, bedrooms, bathrooms, image, etc.
It also lets you add the properties you like to your "Favorites List". Works very similar to Zillow and is nicely formatted and laid out.
